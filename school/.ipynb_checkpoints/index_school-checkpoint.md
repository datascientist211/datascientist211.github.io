title: Analyses and construction of the dutch primary schools dataset
description: " "

---

In the Netherlands children go to primary school on the next day after they turn 4 years old. And before that, when they are 2.5 or 3 year old, their parents should choose a school for them. Ideally â€“ the best school for their baby. It's quite a big problem for a non-native dutch parent like myself. I have no idea what is important, what should I think about, what should I look at in this process. 
I found that Dutch Ministry of education, culture and science opened some data about primary schools. So I want to make a dataset out of the information from their recources and make some data analysis to understand better the dutch system of primary education.

### Dataset construction
1. [Exams scores](./score_first_step.md)
2. [Students level in language and arithmetic and School advices about secondary education](./score_second_step.md)
3. [Students who stayed in primary school longer then others](./score_third_step.md)
4. [Column description for final dataset](./column_description.md)

### Explotatory Data Analysis
1. [EDA for school dataset](./EDA/EDA.md)

### Classifications
1. [Denomination classificator](./Denomination_classificator/Denomination_classificator.md)
2. [CET score level classificator](./CET_score_classificator/CET_score_classificator.md)
